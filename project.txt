npx create-react-app react-weather-app

npm i react-accessible-accordion

npm i react-select-async-paginate --force

npm run start

3 components
1. search on very top
2. for current weather
3. forcast

We are calling 
onChange = {handleOnChange};

const handleOnChange = (searchData) => {			//passing the data 
    setSearch(searchData);					//setting new value
    onSearchChange(searchData);				//calling onSearchChange
  }; 

we are calling onSearchChange
const Search = ({ onSearchChnage }) => {


which is been passed from app.js file
<Search onSearchChange={handleOnSearchChange} />   //calls the method handleOnSearchChange

const handleOnSearchChange = (searchData) => {
    console.log(searchData);					//value we are getting here
  };

What we wanted to get from search is just to get lattitude and logitude from the cities that we want

Now we can create new component 
Current Weather
